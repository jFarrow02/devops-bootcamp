# Intro to Kubernetes

**Kubernetes** is an open source container orchestration tool.

Applications are often composed of 100s, 1000s of containers. Managing such applications manually (using tools like docker-compose) is tedious and highly error-prone.

**Container Orchestration** tools like K8s offer:

1. High availability (no downtime)
2. Scalability (app loads fast, is responsive)
3. Disaster recovery (backup and restore)
