# Minikube and kubectl

**Minikube** is a one-node cluster where manager and worker processes run. Docker is pre-installed. It allows you to deploy new applications/components on your local machine.

**kubectl** is a command line tool for K8s clusters. It is a client that allows you to interact with the Api Server process on the manager node and provision K8s components/services.

kubectl is the tool to interact with **any** K8s cluster (minikube, cloud, etc).

## Installing Minikube
Minkube can run either as a container or VM. To install on a mac:
`brew install minikube`

See official Minikube documentation.

## Starting Minikube
 `minikube start --driver docker`

 `minikube status`: Check status of minikube

 **kubectl** gets installed as a dependency of Minikube, so no need to install it separately.

 `kubectl get node`: Displays status of all nodes in cluster
