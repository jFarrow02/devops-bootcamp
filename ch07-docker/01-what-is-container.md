# What is a Container?

A **container** is a way to package app with all necessary dependencies and configuration.

A **portable artifact**, easily shared and moved around.

## Where do Containers Live?
Containers live in **container repositories**, which can be public or private. The **public** repo for Docker containers is **DockerHub**.

## Why Containers?
- Allow you to run applications in an isolated environment, packaged with all needed configuration

- One command to fetch container and start, regardless of host machine OS

- Simplifies deployment by eliminating dependency version conflicts and miscommunication of deployment configuration details
