# Intro to Terraform

**Terraform** allows you to automate and manage your **infrastructure**, platform, and services that run on your infrastructure. It is open source and **declarative**.

Terraform **provisions infrastructure**.

## What is the Difference Between Ansible and Terraform?
Similarities:
1. Both IAC

Differences
1. Terraform is mainly **infra provisioning tool**:
    - relatively new
    - more advanced in orchestration
2. Ansible is mainly a **configuration tool**:
    - configure the infra once it's constructed
    - deploy apps
    - install/update software
    - more mature

**It's common to use BOTH tools for their own strong points!**

## Common Use Cases
- Replicating infrastructure in new environments (i.e. replicating the dev env in prod, etc.)

## How Does Terraform Connect to Platform Provider?

2 main components:
1. Core: uses 2 input sources:
    - Terraform configureation: What to create/configure (execution plan)
    - State: state of current infrastructure
        - Terraform compares current state to desired end result, and updates current state accordingly.

2. Providers: for specific technologies: AWS, Azure, K8s, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS etc.
    - Create an AWS infra with K8s cluster, services inside etc.
    - Over 100 providers give Terraform access to their resources

## Example Configuration File

```
# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
    version = "~> 2.0"
    region = "us-east-1"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
    cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## How to Make Terraform Take Action?
Commands:

1. `refresh`: query ifra provider to get current state
2. `plan`: create an execution plan to achieve desired state defined in configuration file
3. `apply`: execute the plan
4. `destroy`: destroy the resources/infrastructure in the proper order

## Key Takeaways
1. Terraform is a tool for creating, configuring, and managing infra
2. Terraform is a universal IaC tool for:
    - different cloud providers
    - different technologies
