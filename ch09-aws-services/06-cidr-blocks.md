# CIDR Blocks Explained

A **CIDR block** is a range of IP addresses followed by a `/`, followed by a
number that gives the range of available addresses:

```
172.31.0.0/16  // Available addresses are 172.31.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
```

Once you have a CIDR block, you can allocate a subset block of addresses to
subnets.
