# Regions and Availability Zones

Cloud providers have physical data centers that house the servers on which your cloud applications run. These data centers are distributed throughout the world in **regions**.

You select which region should house your virtual servers based on proximity to you or your customers.

**Availability zones** offer redundancy within a region if a single data center fails. Multiple availability zones within a region.
